Abstract
A negative interest rate policy flips the borrower â€“ lender relationship on its head clouding the understanding of such a policy, which this paper attempts to clear up. Using panel data from 29 countries in the euro area from Q1 2005 to Q4 2019, the impact negative interest rates have on gross domestic product per-capita and the banking sector will be observed. Employing a fixed effects approach, we estimate that the negative interest rate policy does indeed function the way it is intended too, and so far has not caused any significant problems for commercial banks in the area. On average, when the policy interest rate turns negative, GDP per-capita is increased by $1,400. However, this paper will emphasize the negative effects and diminishing returns of such a policy caused by the interest rate heading deeper into negative territory.
